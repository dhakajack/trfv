Bugs ben has found, but not yet ready to file in github bug tracker


R1 Bugs

* WAITING (JACK):  quips when conversation ends, or re-starts (exiting or re-entering room) - R0 is only re-entrant scene and should have these already enabled. I will check other scenes to make sure there is exit/entrance dialogue

  - Related? tell christabell about self
    (benjack-PC) <-- why is this disambiguation being printed??

* make some 'test me' paths

* REFINEMENT:  during R0 scene, background stage business?  or fading
  in/out of christabell ?

* Refinement - look at grammar for all items, is it broad enough, are plurals present? Are likely multiword phrases included as quoted alternatives?

Done: 

(need help from zarf) create better auto-replies to unknown subjects
————
Need to replace these:
block telling rule response (A): "This [provoke] no reaction."
    block asking rule response (A): "[There] [are] no reply."
Can update a library response with
Now the block telling rule response (A) is “xxxxx”
See chapter 14, responses

OK WAITING (JACK): player may ask about scenery -- should they be topics for
  Christabell's commentary?  e.g. "tracks", "cliffs", "weeds"
  jACk is doing

Done

OK REFINEMENT:  shorter quips when asked about same subject multiple
  times

All the ones that need shorter quips have them.


* all of the 'tell' commands are now failing !?!?
  - 'ask foo' FAILS
  - 'ask about foo' works.
  - 'ask woman about foo' works.
  - 'tell woman about foo' works.
  - 'tell about foo" always FAILS

Interesting — this is a library issue.
In the library, there is:
Understand "talk about [any known thing]" as implicit-informing 
But that should be:
Understand "tell about [any known thing]" as implicit-informing
