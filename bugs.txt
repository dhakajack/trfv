Bugs ben has found, but not yet ready to file in github bug tracker


R1 Bugs

* Why does "ask subject" reply "you can't see any such thing", but
  "ask about subject" work fine?

* >tell christabell about self
(benjack-PC)  <-- why is this disambiguation being printed??
blah blah


* ask/tell woman about Christabell --> generic failure messages for
  both

* player may ask about scenery -- should they be topics for
  Christabell's commentary?  e.g. "tracks", "cliffs", "weeds"


* create better auto-replies to unknown subjects

* probably don't need sub-scenes within R1.  Just use Christabell's
  mood alone to decide what topics and/or responses to show.  Perhaps
  save Inform 'scenes' feature only for our actual *big* scenes (R1,
  N1, etc.)
